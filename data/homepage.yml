  title: "Who am I?"
  content: |
    I’m Sathvik Racha, a technology enthusiast and nature aficionado with a penchant for capturing life's moments through the lens of a camera. My journey began in India, where I cultivated a passion for technology that led me to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Bridgeport, Connecticut.
    </br>
    Before coming to the USA, I worked at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in India, where I developed a strong foundation in enterprise software as an SAP Consultant. This role honed my technical skills and ignited my interest in cutting-edge technology solutions.
    </br>
    My fascination with the limitless possibilities of the cloud has directed me towards a career in cloud engineering. With hands-on experience in cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure, I am dedicated to designing and implementing scalable, secure, and efficient cloud solutions. I am particularly interested in exploring how cloud technologies can drive innovation and efficiency in various industries.
    </br>
    Outside of my professional life, I am an avid explorer and an extrovert who loves meeting new people and discovering new places. My passion for photography complements my adventurous spirit, allowing me to capture the beauty of the world around me. Whether it’s hiking in the scenic trails of Portland, Oregon, or engaging with diverse communities, I thrive on new experiences and opportunities to learn and lead.
    </br>
    In essence, I am a lifelong learner, always eager to embrace new challenges and opportunities. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and businesses, and I am committed to making a positive impact through my work.
